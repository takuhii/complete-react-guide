# Section 4.45 - Module Introduction
Now we've learned some important basics of React, it is time to take the next step. We're going to look at user interaction and user events (click input etc) and we are going to look at state in React Apps. With React we follow that declarative approach where we define the deisred target state and React takes care of the rest...

But at the moment in our App, we can only build static applications, where the state never changes. Where we always output exactly the same, we don't want that, we want interactive applications that react to clicks by the user and data being entered, and are reactive so the application changes when things happen.

We are going to look at handling events, user events like clicks, and we'll see how that works in React apps, and hpw we can add event handlers and so on.

We are also going to look at how what we see on the screen chnages, that we reach a different target state, and for that we will look at the state concept in React, how we transition from state A to state B if you will...
