# Section 1.1 - Welcome to the Course
Max introducing himself...


# Section 1.2 - What is ReactJS?
React is a JavaScript Library for writing User Interfaces

Consider NetFLix. It is highly interactive, easy to ue and we don't wait for anything to load.

Mobile apps give a great highly reactive user experience

Traditionally website don't feel like this... Traditionally, in web apps, you click a link and wait for a new page to load. you click a button and wait for some action to complete...

It's this request and response cycle we can break up with JavaScript

JavaScript allows us to run logic in the browser, JavaScript can manipulate the DOM, we can change what the user sees.

ReactJS is a client side JS library. All about modern, reactive UIs for the web.


# Section 1.3 - Why React Instead of "Just JavaScript"?
See code example in resources/section 1.3

The React version works the same way but looks very different
React is all about splitting your application into small componenets, therefore it is maintainable and manageble

We kind of define what to expect as an end result, and then some placeholders, flexible elements, then very simple "instructions" to change what is visible on the screen. 

These are defined by the react library. It makes building complex, rich, UI easier by giving us a higher level syntax where we write code in a declarative way.

TL:DR > We define the end goal, custom HMTL elements, and react does the rest


# Section 1.4 - Building Single-Page Applications (SPAs) with React
Things get easier with React, when working with React we often build Single Page Apps (SPAs). Because we can use React to control parts of a HMTL page, say a sidebar, and we add a widget to the page.

It is more common to control the entire page with react, which means we use React for EVERYTHING, even for switching ages. So when we clikc on a link and load a new page, it looks to the user like we switched pages, but rather we use react to change what is visible on the screen. This leads to a smoother UI and better experience.


# Section 1.5 - Exploring React Alternatives
It is worth noting that there are alternatives to ReactJS

React is one of the best frameworks you can learn, as it is a lean and focused, component based, library. Other features are added via 3rd party libraries and community packages.

Angular is a very popular framework, which is a complete UI based framework and ship with more built in features. Uses Typescript, can be overkill for smaller projects... Syntax can differ from React

VueJS is kind of like a mixture of Angular and React. It is a complete, component based, UI framework, and it includes a lot of features, less than angular but more than react. It has Routing OOTB for example.

# Section 1.6 - Join the Online Learning Community
Join our Online Learning Community
Great to have you on board as a student!

This course also comes with free access to our “Academind Community” on [AcadeMind Discord](https://academind.com/community/)

There, you can find like-minded people, discuss issues, help each other, share progress, successes and ideas and simply have a good time!

I believe that you learn the most if you don't learn alone but find learning partners and other people with similar interests. Our community is a great place for this - it's the perfect complimentary resource for this course.

Joining it is of course free and 100% optional!

We'd love to welcome you on board of the community! :-)


# Section 1.7 - About the Course & Course Outline
What to expect from the course and what is covered.

You might have already looked at the curriculum, this is a huge course and it is advised you give it a brief read, as it is always up to date.

This course is organised into 3 main categories

* 1st category deals with the basics of react, stuff you need to know
We will start with key basics, components and building UIs. Also working with events, data; props and state, and the styling of react apps and components. We will also look at React hooks.

We are learning core react features step-by-step

* 2nd category deals with more advanced concepts, but realistically you will need them in a lot of apps.
We will look at working with side-effects, refs and more react hooks. React Context API and Redux, and handling user inout wirh forms, HTTP Requests and custom hooks. We will also look at implementing Routing, deployment, nextJS and more...

* 3rd category deals with summaries and refreshers on certain concepts.
This section contains a Javascript Refresher, this is 100% optional, as well as a ReactJS summary

Theory and Small Demos and examples will of course be used to help further us along, as well as Bigger more realistic course projects.

Plenty of challenges and exercises as well :)


# Section 1.8 - The Two Paths
There are two ways to take this course...

## Standard approach
You simply start at lecture 1 in section 1 then continue lecture by lecture in order

You can skip the JS refresher if you don't need it

Then use the React summary module to summarise what you learn or to refresh knowledge if you want to remind yourself without going through the entire course

## Summary Approach
Simply skip the entire course and go straight to the react summary module at the end, maybe take the JS Refresher module if you need to.

The summary section is built stand alone, so you don't have to do the whole course, if you already know what you are doing and understand the core features of React

You can still revisit the entire course later on.


# Section 1.9 - Getting the Most Out of this Course
Before we get started with React, lets check out a couple of tips and tricks to help us throuhgout the course

* Watch the videos, choose your pace...
* Code along & practice as you go, if we do code together, pause and try rebuilding what we did.
* It is 100% normal that you will face problems or errors, and you will need to find solutions, use the code attachments to help solve the issues and help you debug. Use what you learn, use google to help solve the problems on your own.
* Use the community to help and learn together. The Discord channel is really active.


# Section 1.10 - Setting Up the Course Dev Environment
For writing react code, any IDE is recommended, ATOM, Sublime Text, WebStorm, but we recommend VSCode. It is free and amazing.

Once you're opened VSCode, you can tweak the appearance, and open files/folders from there.

Settings/styling, fine tune it to your requirements...

Theme: Dark+
Extensions: (ESLint, Git History, Git Project Manager)

*Prettier*: code formatting (format document > SHIFT + OPT + F), search format in settings, set default formatter to prettier.

*Material Icon Theme*: you don't really need this, but this changes the look of the file icons.
